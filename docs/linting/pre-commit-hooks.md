# Pre-commit Hooks Guide

This guide explains the pre-commit hooks setup in the Health Tracker project and how to work with them.

## What Are Pre-commit Hooks?

Pre-commit hooks are automated scripts that run before each `git commit` to ensure code quality standards are met. They act as a quality gate, preventing non-compliant code from entering the repository.

## Why Pre-commit Hooks?

**Benefits:**
- **Catch Issues Early**: Problems are detected before they reach CI/CD or code review
- **Faster Feedback Loop**: Get immediate feedback in your local environment
- **Save CI/CD Resources**: Fewer pipeline failures mean faster builds and lower costs
- **Enforce Standards**: 100% compliance guarantee‚Äînon-compliant code cannot be committed
- **Better Code Quality**: Automatic formatting and linting keep the codebase consistent

**Impact:**
- ‚ö° Immediate feedback (seconds vs minutes in CI/CD)
- üí∞ Reduced CI/CD costs (fewer failed builds)
- ‚úÖ Zero commits violating linting rules
- üöÄ Faster development workflow

## How It Works

### The Stack

1. **Husky** (v9.1.7): Git hooks management tool
2. **lint-staged** (v15.5.2): Runs linters only on staged files for fast performance

### What Runs on Each Commit

When you run `git commit`, the following happens automatically:

```text
git commit
    ‚Üì
Husky triggers
    ‚Üì
lint-staged runs
    ‚Üì
Has staged files?
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Run linters on staged files only
    ‚îÇ           ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ       All checks pass?
    ‚îÇ           ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Commit succeeds ‚úÖ
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ No  ‚Üí Commit blocked ‚ùå
    ‚îî‚îÄ No  ‚Üí Skip
```

### File-Specific Processing

| File Pattern | Tools Applied |
|--------------|---------------|
| `frontend/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` | ESLint --fix ‚Üí Prettier --write |
| `frontend/**/*.css` | Stylelint --fix ‚Üí Prettier --write |
| `frontend/**/*.{json,md}` | Prettier --write |

**Key Points:**
- Only **staged files** are processed (fast performance)
- Tools run with `--fix` and `--write` flags (auto-fixes applied)
- If auto-fix resolves all issues, commit proceeds automatically
- If issues can't be auto-fixed, commit is blocked with error messages

## Installation & Setup

### For New Team Members

When you clone the repository and run `npm install`, Husky hooks are automatically installed via the `prepare` script in `package.json`.

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd health-tracker
npm install  # Hooks installed automatically
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check that .husky/pre-commit exists
ls -la .husky/pre-commit

# Should output: -rwxr-xr-x ... .husky/pre-commit
```

### Manual Reinstallation

If hooks aren't working, reinstall manually:

```bash
cd /Users/francisaraujo/repos/health-tracker
npm run prepare
```

## Usage

### Normal Workflow

Just commit as usual. Hooks run automatically:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
# Hooks run automatically here
```

**Example Output (Success):**
```
husky - pre-commit hook

‚úî Preparing lint-staged...
‚úî Running tasks for staged files...
  ‚úî frontend/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} ‚Äî 3 files
    ‚úî eslint --fix
    ‚úî prettier --write
  ‚úî frontend/**/*.css ‚Äî 2 files
    ‚úî stylelint --fix
    ‚úî prettier --write
‚úî Applying modifications from tasks...
‚úî Cleaning up temporary files...

[feat/my-feature abc1234] feat: add new feature
 5 files changed, 120 insertions(+), 45 deletions(-)
```

**Example Output (Failure):**
```
husky - pre-commit hook

‚úñ Running tasks for staged files...
  ‚úñ frontend/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} ‚Äî 3 files
    ‚úñ eslint --fix

      /path/to/file.tsx
        12:5  error  'useState' is not defined  no-undef

‚úñ lint-staged failed

error Command failed with exit code 1.
```

### Emergency Bypass

**‚ö†Ô∏è Use sparingly and only in emergencies!**

If you need to commit code that fails linting checks (e.g., work-in-progress, emergency hotfix), you can bypass the hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: emergency fix"
```

**When to use `--no-verify`:**
- ‚úÖ Emergency production hotfixes
- ‚úÖ Work-in-progress commits on feature branches
- ‚úÖ Temporary debugging code
- ‚ùå **Never** to bypass legitimate linting errors on main/develop branches
- ‚ùå **Never** as a regular practice

**Note:** Even if you bypass pre-commit hooks, CI/CD will still catch violations and fail the build.

## Configuration

### lint-staged Configuration

Located in root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "frontend/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "frontend/**/*.css": [
      "stylelint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "frontend/**/*.{json,md}": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hook Script

Located at `.husky/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Hooks Not Running

**Symptoms:** Commits succeed without any linting output

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Husky is installed:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .husky/pre-commit
   # Should show executable file
   ```

2. **Check file permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
   ```

3. **Reinstall hooks:**
   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

4. **Check Git hooks path:**
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath
   # Should output: .husky
   ```

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Symptoms:** Pre-commit hook takes >10 seconds

**Solutions:**
1. **Only stage necessary files:**
   ```bash
   git add specific-file.ts
   # Instead of: git add .
   ```

2. **Check what's staged:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Unstage large/unnecessary files
   ```

3. **Bypass for large commits (use sparingly):**
   ```bash
   git commit --no-verify
   ```

### Issue: "command not found: npx"

**Symptoms:** Error message about missing `npx`

**Solutions:**
1. **Ensure Node.js is installed:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

2. **Reinstall Node.js** (if not installed)

3. **Update npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

### Issue: ESLint/Stylelint Errors Can't Be Auto-fixed

**Symptoms:** Commit fails with linting errors even after auto-fix

**Solutions:**
1. **Read the error messages carefully** - they usually indicate what needs manual fixing

2. **Fix issues manually:**
   ```bash
   # For ESLint errors
   cd frontend && npm run lint

   # For Stylelint errors
   cd frontend && npm run lint:css
   ```

3. **Common issues that require manual fixes:**
   - Missing imports (`no-undef`)
   - Unused variables (`no-unused-vars`)
   - Type errors (TypeScript)
   - Complex code style issues

4. **After fixing, stage and commit again:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve linting issues"
   ```

### Issue: Hooks Fail After Merging main

**Symptoms:** Hooks work on main but fail after merging

**Solutions:**
1. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Rebuild Husky:**
   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

3. **Check for conflicts in package.json:**
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD package.json
   ```

### Issue: Husky Deprecation Warnings

**Symptoms:** Seeing warnings about Husky v10

**Status:** This is expected. We're using Husky v9.1.7 which shows deprecation warnings for the v9 format. The hooks still work correctly.

**Action:** No action needed currently. Migration to v10 format will be done in a future update.

## Performance Tips

### Only Process Changed Files

lint-staged already does this automatically! It only runs linters on **staged files**, not the entire codebase.

**Performance comparison:**
- **Full codebase lint**: ~30-60 seconds
- **lint-staged (5 files)**: ~2-5 seconds

### Commit Frequently with Smaller Changes

Smaller commits = fewer files to lint = faster hooks

```bash
# Good: Small, focused commits
git add src/components/Button.tsx
git commit -m "feat: add Button component"

git add src/components/Button.test.tsx
git commit -m "test: add Button tests"

# Slower: Large commit with many files
git add src/
git commit -m "feat: add all components"
```

## Integration with CI/CD

Pre-commit hooks are the **first line of defense**. CI/CD provides the **final enforcement**:

1. **Local (Pre-commit)**: Fast feedback, auto-fixes applied
2. **CI/CD**: Full codebase validation, blocks PR merges

Even if you bypass pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify`, CI/CD will still catch violations.

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Let hooks run normally on every commit
‚úÖ Fix linting errors when they occur
‚úÖ Keep commits small and focused for faster hooks
‚úÖ Read error messages carefully‚Äîthey guide you to the fix
‚úÖ Use `--no-verify` only for legitimate emergencies

### DON'T:
‚ùå Routinely bypass hooks with `--no-verify`
‚ùå Commit large numbers of files at once
‚ùå Ignore linting errors and "fix them later"
‚ùå Disable hooks globally
‚ùå Add `--no-verify` to automated scripts

## FAQ

### Q: Can I disable pre-commit hooks permanently?

**A:** No, and you shouldn't. Pre-commit hooks are a team standard that ensures code quality. If hooks are causing issues, follow the troubleshooting guide above.

### Q: What if I'm working on a WIP feature and want to commit broken code?

**A:** Use `--no-verify` for WIP commits on feature branches, but fix all issues before creating a PR:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: experimental feature"
# Later, before PR:
git commit -m "feat: complete experimental feature"  # Hooks run normally
```

### Q: Why are my commits taking longer now?

**A:** Pre-commit hooks add a few seconds to each commit, but save much more time by:
- Preventing CI/CD failures (minutes saved)
- Reducing code review back-and-forth (hours saved)
- Catching bugs early (hours/days saved)

The trade-off is worth it!

### Q: Can I customize which files run which linters?

**A:** Yes! Edit the `lint-staged` configuration in root `package.json`. See the Configuration section above.

### Q: What happens if I bypass hooks and push to main?

**A:** The CI/CD pipeline will catch violations and fail the build. The PR will be blocked from merging until all checks pass.
